## Expo React Native App Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for the Expo-generated React Native app! This guide will walk you through the steps to get the app up and running on your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js (at least version 12) and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-expo-app.git
cd your-expo-app

2. **Install Dependencies:**
npm install

3. **Start the Development Server:**
npx expo start

This will start the Expo development server. You can now use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to scan the QR code and run the app.

4. **Running on Emulator:**
If you prefer using an emulator, you can press 'a' in the terminal where the Expo server is running to open the app in the Android emulator, or 'i' for the iOS simulator.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: The entry point of your app. You can start building your app by editing this file.
- `assets/`: Place your static assets like images, fonts, etc. here.
- `components/`: Organize your reusable components in this directory.
- `screens/`: Create individual screens of your app in this directory.
- `navigation/`: Configure your app's navigation using React Navigation or any other navigation library.
